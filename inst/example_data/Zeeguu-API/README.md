# Zeeguu-API ![Build Status](https://github.com/zeeguu-ecosystem/Zeeguu-API/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)


Zeeguu-API is an open API that allows tracking and modeling the progress of a learner in a foreign language with the goal of recommending paths to accelerate vocabulary acquisition. The API is also currently deployed as the backend for the [zeeguu.org](https://zeeguu.org) website. 

## Overview

The API offers translations for the words that a learner encounters in their readings. The history of the translated words and their context is saved and used to build a dynamic model of the user knowledge. The context is used to extract the words the user knows and their topics of interest.

A teacher agent recommends the most important words to be studied next in order for the learner to accelerate his vocabulary retention. This information can be used as input by language exercise applications, for example interactive games.

A text recommender agent crawls websites of interest to the user and recommend materials to read which are in the zone of proximal development.

# Development Notes

Once you clone the repo, please run: 

    git config --local core.hooksPath .githooks/

This will make the rules in the .githooks/rules 
folder be run before every commit. The rules
check for well-known bugs and code conventions.


# Installation
1. Install ``docker`` on your machine. For Ubuntu you can run the following:

```sh
sudo apt-get install docker.io -y
```

2. (Optional) Build docker images with the steps described [here](/docker/README.md).

3. Start mysql database by running a container with ``zeeguu/zeeguu-mysql`` image:

```sh
docker run --net=host --name=zeeguu-mysql -d zeeguu/zeeguu-mysql
```

Before continuing you should make sure the mysql database is ready to accept connections, otherwise zeeguu-api-core container will not start.
To check that, you can run:
```sh
$ docker logs zeeguu-mysql
...
2018-11-01T17:13:15.296779Z 0 [Note] Event Scheduler: Loaded 0 events
2018-11-01T17:13:15.296965Z 0 [Note] mysqld: ready for connections.
Version: '5.7.24'  socket: '/var/run/mysqld/mysqld.sock'  port: 3306  MySQL Community Server (GPL)
```
If you see the above lines at the end of the output then you are ready to proceed with the next steps.

4. Start Zeeguu API and Core by running a container with ``zeeguu/zeeguu-api-core`` image:

```sh
docker run --net=host --name=zeeguu-api-core -d zeeguu/zeeguu-api-core
```

You can check that the zeeguu-api-core container is started by running ``docker ps``. You should see the following:

```sh
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID        IMAGE                    COMMAND                  CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
31373fb67f01        zeeguu/zeeguu-api-core   "python zeeguu_api"      1 second ago        Up 1 second                             zeeguu-api-core
0b988ad5956e        zeeguu/zeeguu-mysql      "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   6 minutes ago       Up 6 minutes                            zeeguu-mysql
```

5. To make sure that the API works, you can call the `/available_languages` endpoint from a terminal like this:

     `curl 127.0.0.1:9001/available_languages`
     
6. If the answer is something like `["de", "es", "fr", "nl", "en"]` you have the API working.

Go have fun!

# Rchitecture

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This package is my report for the architectural recovery assignment on the Software Architecture course at ITU in Spring 2021. The purpose is to recover meaningful views from a software project. I went with the default example, the [Zeeguu-Api](https://github.com/zeeguu-ecosystem/Zeeguu-API) for analysis. 

## Approach and dependencies

After some initial struggles with parsing the python AST trees in R I settled on the following :

- [kavon/yaml-ast](https://github.com/kavon/yaml-ast) and [maligree/python-ast-explorer](https://github.com/maligree/python-ast-explorer) for parsing python AST into data structures.
- ðŸ“¦`reticulate` for calling those python scripts from R
- ðŸ“¦`data.tree` for parsing yaml (and directories) into data.tree objects that could then be converted into igraph objects
- ðŸ“¦`igraph` behind the scenes and for implementations of different graph algorithms
- ðŸ“¦`tidygraph` for a tidy interface to manipulate the graphs
- ðŸ“¦`ggraph` for plotting graphs

Furthermore, I am using ðŸ“¦`tidyverse` for most of the data manipulation and additional plotting. The documentation website is built using ðŸ“¦`pkgdown`.
## Installation

You can install the released version of Rchitecture from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("Rchitecture")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(Rchitecture)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
